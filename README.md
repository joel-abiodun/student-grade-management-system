# Student Grade Management System (Python)

## Student Information
- **Name:** Joel Abiodun  
- **Matric Number:** 25/18070  
- **Department:** Computer Science  
- **Institution:** Caleb University

## Project Overview
The **Student Grade Management System** is a console-based Python application developed to manage student academic results.  
The system collects student scores, calculates total scores, assigns grades based on predefined rules, and displays the final result.

This project was developed as part of an academic assessment and follows proper software development practices.

---

## Aim and Objectives

### Aim
To design and implement a simple Python-based system for calculating and managing student grades.

### Objectives
- To collect student details and scores  
- To calculate total scores automatically  
- To assign grades based on score ranges  
- To display student results clearly  
- To apply basic programming and software development concepts  

---

## Scope of the Project
The scope of this project is limited to:
- A single student record at a time  
- Console-based interaction  
- Score calculation and grade assignment  

The system does not include database storage or graphical interfaces.

---

## Features of the System
- User-friendly console interface  
- Accepts student name, test score, and exam score  
- Automatically calculates total score  
- Assigns grades (A–F)  
- Displays formatted student results  

---

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python 3  
- **Integrated Development Environment(IDE) used:** Visual Studio Code (VSC)  
- **Version Control:** GitHub  

---

## Program File Description
- **student_grade_system.py** – Contains the Python source code  
- **README.md** – Project documentation  
- **SDLC_Waterfall_Model.docx** – SDLC documentation  

---

## How to Run the Program

```bash
python student_grade_system.py
```

---

## Sample Output

```
===== Student Grade Management System =====
Enter student name: John
Enter test score (out of 30): 25
Enter exam score (out of 70): 50

----- Student Result -----
Student Name: John
Test Score: 25
Exam Score: 50
Total Score: 75
Grade: A
--------------------------
```

---

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
The system was developed using the **Waterfall Model**.
Detailed SDLC documentation is provided in **SDLC_Waterfall_Model.docx**.

---

## Limitations
- Supports only one student at a time  
- No data storage  
- Console-based  

---

## Future Enhancements
- Multiple student records  
- Database integration  
- GUI implementation  

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates effective use of Python programming and software development principles.
